# Yet Another Database (ya-db)

Yet Another Database or ya-db in short, is just yet another database.
This is an experimental and reearch database I am working on to understand the following:
- Database Management System
  - How to Store data in a file
  - When to move data from files to in-mem
  - how does index work
  - how does object structures work
- This project will be build using C. Moving ahead the documentation might be swicthed to Rust
  - Learning basics and intermediate C
  - Working on datastructures and algorithms using C
- Programming Langauge/Compiler/Interpreter
  - Build a Lexxer/Parser to work with SQL statements
  - Conovert those tokens into commands to work with
